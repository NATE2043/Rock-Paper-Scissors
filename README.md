# Rock,Paper,Scissors

After looking at a few Games that i could create with JavaScript and i always liked Rock-Paper-Scissors and it seemed like a fun game to start off with so here it is i hope its not too dull but it a good laugh trying to win against the computer!!
This is my first javascript project i started off with a questionaire butit was too much for me and ended up starting the game witch i think it very fun to play i wanted to keep it simple and straight forward you select one of the symbols of either [rock, papper or scissors] and the score should increment and you can play againist the computer as long as you want it will rest once you refresh the screen.


## Acknowledgements

I Watched the youtube channel for help on how to make the JavaScript work using the correct functions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yS-JV4fWqY his name is Kyle and his youtube channel is https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified he made it alot easier to understand the functions and what they do to make my game work imcrementing the score and and making the number change as the game gose on, it was very helpful, I cant thank him enough for explaining the process enough very simplfied for beginners. 
## Features

The Name of the game is Rock, Paper, Scissors and is at the top of the page and below this is a h2 with the please make a selection below that is the 3 sysmbols for the game (Rock) which was an simple emoji from the keyboard emoji's coppied over as was the (SCISSORS) emoji also the paper was a emoji of a toilet paper that i added in for humour.

I wanted the emoji's pop just for some added effect and also to make it obvious which selecttion you were making !

The game it self will calculate the scores based off your choices and will continue untill the screen is refreshed.
You will also be able to review you choices and the computers choices by scrolling down to see what was selected in the past moves of the current game.

I used simple emoji's that i found on my keyboard witchi just copy and pasted into the HTML section.

## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  npm run test
```

I ran a lighthouse check and it was sucessful,I also used the rocommended html, css and javascript checkers whitch all came back with no errors found in the HTML and the CSS but the javascript was unclear i have attached screenshots of each.


## Color Reference

| Color             | RGB                                                                |

I picked this blue colour because I taught it was easy on the eye and reminde me of the blue in spue mario bro's and i taught it would give the game a simple look and not have too much going on in the background
background-color: rgb(0, 21, 255);

I Choose a simple White: rgb(255, 255, 255); for the Fonts to make them stand out n the blue.

The rock and the Scissors are black just to break it up a small bit
